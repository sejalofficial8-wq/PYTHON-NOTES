Data types are classifications that define the kind of values a variable or expression can hold in programming, database management, and other computational contexts. They determine how data is stored, the operations that can be performed on it, and how it is interpreted by a computer system.
Data types play a very important role. 
If the data types are defined clearly half of the problems get cleared.
